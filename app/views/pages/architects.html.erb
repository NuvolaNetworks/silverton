			<h3>Getting it right from the start</h3>
			<p>
				Silverton Custom Homes has long-standing relationships with several revered Austin architects. These relationships have extended for nearly 20 years and makes for a more efficient process. These proven collaborations help us deliver a budget-conscious plan that hits the mark right from the start.

			<p>
				Our comprehensive design process begins with hand drawn sketches before progressing to the computer with a design that maximizes the home site’s unique characteristics while fulfilling the client’s requirements. The final design is then reviewed by a third party for quality assurance. This solid upfront design is key to eliminating costly revisions and delays down the road.
